Just a simple "memory" game, where:
- clicking a card will reveal it,
- at most two cards can be revealed at the same time
- if the revelead cars are a matched pair, theywill remain visible until the game finishes
- nmatched revealed pairs are hidden as soon as another card is clicked

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com), this sample game is entirely hook-based, and uses Context API for state management.
